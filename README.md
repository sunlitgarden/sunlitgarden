### Welcome to Taylor M.'s Github profile 🎉

This is [my website](https://sunlitgarden.github.io) (made with Github pages). I'm using it as a reading list until I have certifications and completed projects to display. 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [an art prompt application for artists to randomly generate poses](https://github.com/sunlitgarden/Art-Prompt-Generator). I'm a firm believer in learning by doing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use Tableau and Docker. 
- 📫 You can message me at sunlitgarden@protonmail.com for any questions or concerns.
